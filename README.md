# Welcome to Battle for BFDI : BRAWL!
This repository once became a version control and project store for people to edit. However, the lack of participation and several technical issues rendered the repo unusable. This place only acts as a web hosting for feature tests. You can go to the link in the description to playtest the current developments for BFB: BRAWL.

We also have a community of object show fans discussing about the game via our Discord server! Do check out the place through this invite: discord.gg/RnYC366
