# Welcome to BFDI : BRAWL!
## Be Resilient and Win Luxury!

BFDI: BRAWL is a fan-made project founded by smolpadok since December 2017. It features a Smash Ultimate-esque gameplay with all 65 lovable characters from BFDI seasons, Jacknjellify's animation series on YouTube. This game is built all out of love for the object show community and it is an open-sourced project. Thus, we welcome everyone to contribute to the game and even create your very own mods of BFDI: BRAWL.

BFDI:BRAWL has undergone many iterations, with V3 being the latest one, it is designed from the ground up with bedrock foundations and optimized for future scaling and modifications by the community.

We have the object show community discussing about the game on the BFDI: BRAWL Discord server! Do check out the place through this invite: discord.gg/RnYC366
