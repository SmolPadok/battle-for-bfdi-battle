# Welcome to Battle for BFDI Battle!
This place is the heart of the BFBB development. Note that the current version is still unstable and virtually unplayable.

## Playing the game?
For your convenience, BFBB will be available as a WebGL version in its own website. It will be ready in a couple of months, and soon you'll be able to play it right on your web browser!

But as for now, you need to create the standalone yourself by building the project in Unity3D. Quite a hassle.
 
## Downloading this project?
Click the download/clone button and save it in your desired location. You will be needing Unity3D 2019.2 or above to open it. Please visit the wiki for more information.

## Found any issues? Any great ideas in mind?
GitHub provides a section to send in bugs that occur during the game as well as giving suggestions to add more cool features. Simply head to the Issues tab and write an issue. To explain your issue better, add pictures to clarify your issue.
