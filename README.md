# Welcome to BFDI : BRAWL!

BFDI: BRAWL is a fan-made project founded by smolpadok since December 2017. It features a Smash Ultimate-esque gameplay with all 65 lovable characters from BFDI seasons, Jacknjellify's animation series on YouTube. This game is built all out of love for the object show community and it is an open-sourced project. Thus, we welcome everyone to contribute to the game and even create your very own mods of BFDI: BRAWL.

We also have a community of object show fans discussing about the game via our Discord server! Do check out the place through this invite: discord.gg/RnYC366
